# Agents working on GBrain

This is your install + operating protocol. Claude Code reads `./CLAUDE.md` automatically.
Everyone else (Codex, Cursor, OpenClaw, Aider, Continue, or an LLM fetching via URL):
start here.

## Install (5 min)

1. Install gbrain via Bun (the canonical path):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"
   bun install -g github:garrytan/gbrain
   ```
   If `bun install -g` aborts or `gbrain doctor` reports `schema_version: 0`,
   the CLI prints a recovery hint pointing at [#218](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain/issues/218).
   Run `gbrain apply-migrations --yes` to recover, or fall back to the
   deterministic install: `git clone https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain.git ~/gbrain && cd ~/gbrain && bun install && bun link`.
2. Init the brain: `gbrain init` (defaults to PGLite, zero-config). For 1000+ files or
   multi-machine sync, init suggests Postgres + pgvector via Supabase.
3. **STOP — ask the user about search mode.** `gbrain init` auto-applied a
   default but printed a 9-cell cost matrix (mode × downstream model)
   preceded by `[AGENT]` markers. You MUST relay the matrix to the operator
   and confirm their choice before continuing. Cost spread between corners
   is 25x — silent acceptance is the wrong default. See
   [`./INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md`](./INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md) Step 3.5 for the
   exact ask-the-user protocol. Same banner fires on `gbrain post-upgrade`
   for existing users (search modes were added in v0.32.3).
4. Read [`./INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md`](./INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md) for the full 9-step flow
   (API keys, identity, cron, verification).

## Read this order

1. `./AGENTS.md` (this file) — install + operating protocol.
2. [`./CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — orientation + resolver: architecture, cross-cutting
   invariants, the reference map, inline ship rules. It routes to on-demand detail docs:
   [`./docs/architecture/KEY_FILES.md`](./docs/architecture/KEY_FILES.md) (per-file index —
   read a file's entry before editing it), [`./docs/TESTING.md`](./docs/TESTING.md) (test
   tiers + isolation lint + E2E lifecycle), and
   [`./docs/architecture/thin-client.md`](./docs/architecture/thin-client.md) (remote-MCP seam).
3. [`./docs/architecture/brains-and-sources.md`](./docs/architecture/brains-and-sources.md)
   — the two-axis mental model (brain = which DB, source = which repo in the DB). Every
   query routes on both axes. Read before writing anything that touches brain ops.
4. [`./skills/conventions/brain-routing.md`](./skills/conventions/brain-routing.md) —
   agent-facing decision table: when to switch brain, when to switch source, how
   cross-brain federation works (latent-space only; the agent decides).
5. [`./skills/RESOLVER.md`](./skills/RESOLVER.md) — skill dispatcher. Read before any task.

## Trust boundary (critical)

GBrain distinguishes **trusted local CLI callers** (`OperationContext.remote = false`,
set by `src/cli.ts`) from **untrusted agent-facing callers** (`remote = true`, set by
`src/mcp/server.ts`). Security-sensitive operations like `file_upload` tighten filesystem
confinement when `remote = true` and default to strict behavior when unset. If you are
writing or reviewing an operation, consult `src/core/operations.ts` for the contract.

## Common tasks

- **Configure:** [`docs/ENGINES.md`](./docs/ENGINES.md),
  [`docs/guides/live-sync.md`](./docs/guides/live-sync.md),
  [`docs/mcp/DEPLOY.md`](./docs/mcp/DEPLOY.md).
- **Debug:** [`docs/GBRAIN_VERIFY.md`](./docs/GBRAIN_VERIFY.md),
  [`docs/guides/minions-fix.md`](./docs/guides/minions-fix.md), `gbrain doctor --fix`.
- **Migrate / upgrade:** `gbrain upgrade` (binary self-update + schema migrations + post-upgrade prompts),
  [`docs/UPGRADING_DOWNSTREAM_AGENTS.md`](./docs/UPGRADING_DOWNSTREAM_AGENTS.md),
  [`skills/migrations/`](./skills/migrations/), `gbrain apply-migrations --yes` (manual schema-only).
- **Eval retrieval changes:** capture is off by default. To benchmark a
  retrieval change against real captured queries, set
  `GBRAIN_CONTRIBUTOR_MODE=1`, then `gbrain eval export --since 7d > base.ndjson`
  and `gbrain eval replay --against base.ndjson`. For public benchmark
  coverage (LongMemEval, ground-truth scoring), `gbrain eval longmemeval
  <dataset.jsonl>` (v0.28.8) runs against an isolated in-memory PGLite
  per question — your `~/.gbrain` is never opened. Full guide:
  [`docs/eval-bench.md`](./docs/eval-bench.md).
- **Drive the brain to a target health score (v0.36.4.0):** the one-command
  loop. `gbrain doctor --remediation-plan --json` previews what would be
  fixed; `gbrain doctor --remediate --yes --target-score 90 --max-usd 5`
  walks a dependency-ordered plan (sync before extract, embed after
  consolidate), re-checking score between every step, refusing to spend
  past the cost cap. Empty brains (no entity pages) or unconfigured embedding
  keys hit a `max_reachable_score` ceiling and bail with what's missing.
  Three phase handlers (synthesize / patterns / consolidate) are
  PROTECTED — only trusted local callers can submit them; MCP cannot.
  Reference: [`docs/architecture/topologies.md`](./docs/architecture/topologies.md)
  and the CHANGELOG entry for v0.36.4.0.
- **Track a founder/company over time (v0.35.7):** when an entity has
  typed metric claims in its `## Facts` fence (`metric: mrr`, `value: 50000`,
  `unit: USD`, `period: monthly` columns), run
  `gbrain eval trajectory <entity-slug>` for the chronological history
  with regressions auto-flagged, or `gbrain founder scorecard <entity-slug>`
  for a four-signal JSON rollup (claim_accuracy / consistency /
  growth_trajectory / red_flags). MCP op `find_trajectory` exposes the
  same data — read scope, visibility-filtered for remote callers. **v0.40.2.0:**
  `gbrain think` now uses this substrate automatically on temporal /
  knowledge_update intent (default ON; flip `think.trajectory_enabled=false`
  to opt out). Migration v82 added `facts.event_type` so non-metric event
  rows (`meeting`, `job_change`, `location_change`) ride through the same
  pipeline; pass `kind: 'event'` or `'all'` to `find_trajectory` to query
  them.
- **Everything else:** [`./llms.txt`](./llms.txt) is the full documentation map.
  [`./llms-full.txt`](./llms-full.txt) is the same map with core docs inlined for
  single-fetch ingestion.

## Agent routing

Keep simple or tightly coupled work on the main agent. The main agent owns
initial diagnosis, task decomposition, integration, final judgment, and
validation.

Use `fast_scan` only for one materially ambiguous read-only question where
independent context or stronger investigation is likely to prevent an
incorrect implementation.

Do not invoke `fast_scan` for:

- locating a known file;
- listing a known directory;
- reading files already identified by the main agent;
- repeating the main agent's repository inspection;
- receiving the complete implementation task.

Every `fast_scan` assignment must define:

- one concrete question;
- fixed repository, directory, or file scope;
- explicit exclusions;
- concise evidence requirements;
- a stop condition.

Use `routine_worker` once for a fixed implementation scope with explicit
validation. Do not send it broad repository governance, architecture discovery,
or unresolved placement decisions unless those are part of the assigned
bounded task.

Use `deep_worker` only for a named complex or high-risk blocker localized by
the main agent. Do not invoke it as a general second implementation attempt.

Invoke `advisor` only after targeted validation passes and only for
consequential security, governance, tenant-isolation, deployment,
canonical-write, migration, destructive-operation, or cross-repository
changes. Use at most one advisor pass unless the user explicitly requests
another.

The advisor is read-only. Its findings are proposals, not authority. The main
agent must verify material findings against repository evidence before applying
corrections.

Default workflow:

main-agent diagnosis
→ optional single fast_scan
→ routine_worker implementation
→ main-agent diff inspection
→ conditional advisor
→ bounded corrections
→ final validation

Do not run parallel write agents against overlapping files or responsibilities.

Stop and report instead of starting another agent when:

- a second implementation worker would be required;
- advisor findings require architectural redesign outside the approved scope;
- deferred scope becomes necessary;
- the same validation fails twice because of harness or environment problems;
- repository ownership, source of truth, or placement remains unresolved.

## Branch policy

Work directly on the repository's default branch unless the user explicitly
requests an isolated branch.

Do not automatically create, switch, rename, rebase, or delete branches for
normal tasks.

Before writing:

- identify the repository's actual default branch;
- confirm the current checkout is that branch;
- confirm the working tree state;
- pull only with `--ff-only` when synchronization is required.

The default branch is normally `main`. Use the repository's actual configured
default where different; `gbrain-upstream` currently uses `master`.

With uncommitted work present, preserve it before switching branches. Do not
stash, reset, or move work between branches unless the user explicitly approves
that operation.

Use small commits, targeted validation, and frequent pushes to preserve
recoverability when working directly on the default branch.

## Before shipping

Easiest path: `bun run ci:local` runs the full CI gate inside Docker (gitleaks,
guards + typecheck, then 4-shard parallel unit + E2E against four pgvector
containers plus a transaction-mode PgBouncer; unit phase keeps `DATABASE_URL`
unset) and tears down. Use `bun run ci:local:diff` for the
diff-aware subset during fast iteration on a focused branch. Requires Docker
(Docker Desktop / OrbStack / Colima) and `gitleaks` (`brew install gitleaks`).

Manual path: `bun test` plus the E2E lifecycle described in `./CLAUDE.md` (spin
up the test Postgres container, run `bun run test:e2e`, tear it down).

Ship via the `/ship` skill, not by hand. The full release + contributor process
(CHANGELOG voice, version-locations sync, PR conventions, community-PR-wave) lives in
[`./docs/RELEASING.md`](./docs/RELEASING.md); read it before shipping.

## Privacy

Never commit real names of people, companies, or funds into public artifacts. See the
Privacy rule in `./CLAUDE.md`. GBrain pages reference real contacts; public docs must
use generic placeholders (`alice-example`, `acme-example`, `fund-a`).

## Forks

If you are a fork, regenerate `llms.txt` + `llms-full.txt` with your own URL base before
publishing: `LLMS_REPO_BASE=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/your-fork/main bun run build:llms`.
